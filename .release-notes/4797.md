## Fix crash when using bare integer literals in array match patterns

Array does not implement the Equatable interface, which queries for structural equality.  Previous to this fix, an error in the type inference logic resulted in the code below resulting in a compiler crash instead of the expected helpful error message:

```pony
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let arr: Array[U8 val] = [4; 5]
    match arr
    | [2; 3] => None
    else
      None
    end
```

Now, the correct helpful error message is provided:

```quote
Error:
main.pony:5:7: couldn't find 'eq' in 'Array'
    | [2; 3] => None
      ^
Error:
main.pony:5:7: this pattern element doesn't support structural equality
    | [2; 3] => None
      ^
```
