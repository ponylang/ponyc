## Add Alpine 3.22 as a supported platform

We've added arm64 and amd64 builds for Alpine Linux 3.22.  We'll be building ponyc releases for it until it stops receiving security updates in 2027. At that point, we'll stop building releases for it.

## Stop creating Fedora 41 builds

We are no longer creating Fedora 41 builds of Pony. Fedora 41 is about to reach its end of life. If you need Pony support on Fedora 41, you will need to build from source.
