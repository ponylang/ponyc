## Add Pony Language Server to the Ponyc distribution

We've moved the Pony Language Server that previously was distributed as it's own project to the standard ponyc distribution. This means that the language server will track changes in ponyc. Going forward, the language server that ships with a given ponyc will be fully up-to-date with the compiler and most importantly, it's version of the standard library.
