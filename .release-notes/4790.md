## Fix compiler crash when assigning ephemeral capability types

Assigning ephemeral capability to a variable was causing the compiler to crash. We've updated to provide a descriptive error message.

Where previously code like:

```pony
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) => 
    let c: String iso^ = String
```

caused a segfault, you will now get a helpful error message instead:

```quote
Error:
/tmp/main.pony:3:24: Invalid type for field of assignment: String iso^
    let c: String iso^ = String
```
