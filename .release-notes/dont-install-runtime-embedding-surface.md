## Stop installing the Pony runtime's C headers and static libraries

On Linux, macOS, and the BSDs, `make install` used to place ponyc's C runtime headers (`pony.h`, `paths.h`, `threads.h`, and a few others) into `<prefix>/include` and its runtime static libraries (`libponyrt.a` and friends) into `<prefix>/lib`, where `<prefix>` defaults to `/usr/local`. These were only there to support embedding the Pony runtime in a non-Pony C program by hand, which Pony does not support.

They also caused a real problem. The installed `paths.h` shadowed the system's own `<paths.h>`, and `threads.h` shadowed the C11 `<threads.h>`, so an unrelated C program that included one of those system headers could pick up Pony's by mistake.

ponyc no longer installs those headers or libraries into the shared directories. If you have a from-source install from an earlier version, your next `make install` or `make uninstall` clears out the old symlinks — only its own symlinks, never a file you put there yourself. (A prior install done with a custom `ponydir` isn't recognized by the cleanup; remove its stale `<prefix>/include/*.h` and `<prefix>/lib/libponyrt*` symlinks by hand.)

Writing C shims for your Pony code is unaffected: ponyc hands its headers to the shim compiler directly, so `#include <pony.h>` and `#include <ponyassert.h>` (for `pony_assert`) keep working with no setup. The `ponyc` compiler, the `pony-lsp`/`pony-lint`/`pony-doc` tools, and linking against `libponyc` to use the compiler as a library are all unaffected.
