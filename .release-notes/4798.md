## Add hover support for receiver capability to LSP

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) hover feature now displays receiver capabilities in method signatures.

When hovering over a method reference, the hover information will now show the receiver capability (e.g., `box`, `val`, `ref`, `iso`, `trn`, `tag`) in the method signature. This provides more complete type information at a glance.

### Examples

Previously, hovering over a method would show:

```pony
fun boxed_method(): String
```

Now, it correctly displays:

```pony
fun box boxed_method(): String
```

This applies to all receiver capabilities:

- `fun box method()` - read-only access
- `fun ref method()` - mutable reference access  
- `fun val method()` - immutable value access
- `fun iso method()` - isolated reference access
- `fun trn method()` - transition reference access
- `fun tag method()` - opaque reference access
