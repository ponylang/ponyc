## Fix race condition between actor GC and ASIO subsystem

Prior to this change, there was a race condition between actor garbage collection and the ASIO subsystem. The end result of this very rarely triggered race condition would be an assertion failure when using a debug version of the Pony runtime and the inability for a program to reach quiescence when using a release version of the runtime.

The bug was found by a recently introduced stress test that opens and closes lots and lots of TCP connections thereby exercising the ASIO subsystem and the actor garbage collector.
