## Fix "double socket close" issue with Windows version of TCPConnection

When fixing a number of "smaller" Windows TCP networking issues a couple years back, in addition to fixing those issues, we introduced a new bug. That bug lingered for two years. It lingered in large part because it would only become apparent in a low resource environment.

When we recently switched our Windows CI from CirrusCI to GitHub Actions, we went from a high-resource environment to a low-resource environment and started getting a ton of "random" Windows TCP test failures.

The problem that was fairly easy to recreate in a test environment would be fairly unlikely in most applications but existed nontheless. The scenario in our test environment was like this:

- Test 1 runs and completes but hasn't done test teardown yet
- Test 2 starts up
- Test 1 runs the "buggy" line of code and closes the socket it has been using with OS, but doesn't reset its own internal record of the file descriptor for the socket.
- Test 2 is gets a socket from the OS with the file descriptor for the socket just closed by Test 1
- Test 1 still has a "valid" file descriptor and as part of full shutdown, closes the socket associated with "its" file descriptor. When Test 1 does this, test 2's socket closes and the test fails to complete successfully.

The problem would appear "in the wild" if a Windows application was quickly closing and opening TCP sockets in a manner similiar to the Pony standard library TCP tests.
