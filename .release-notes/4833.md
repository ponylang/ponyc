## Fix persistent HashMap returning incorrect results for None values

The persistent `HashMap` used `None` as an internal sentinel to signal "key not found" in its lookup methods. This collided with user value types that include `None` (e.g., `Map[String, (String | None)]`), causing `apply` to raise instead of returning the stored `None`, `contains` to return `false` for keys mapped to `None`, and `get_or_else` to return the alternate value instead of the stored `None`.

The internal lookup methods now use `error` instead of `None` to signal a missing key, so all value types work correctly.
