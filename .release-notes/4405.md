Due to a logical flaw in the `pony_check` package regarding how the `_PropertyRunner` handles `expect_action(...)` and `complete_action(...)`/`fail_action(...)` calls, it was possible for lingering executions of previous runs to call into the `_PropertyRunner` instance that was already handling another run, completing or failing some actions of the current run. This has resulted in occasional hangs in CI.

With this change the hangs could not be reproduces locally or in CI.
