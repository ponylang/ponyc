## Don't duplicate visibility tests for inherited trait bodies

Due to how we were implementing name lookups, some usages of calling private methods on a trait from within the body of a default method on the same trait would fail if a class from outside the package tried to implement the trait.

For example, if you defined the following trait:

```pony
trait T
  fun _override(): (T | None)

  fun _with_default() =>
    """
    Will compile if #4613 remains fixed. Otherwise, this will fail to
    compiled IFF a class from outside this package implements this trait
    and inherits this default method
    """
    match _override()
    | let t: T =>
      t._with_default()
    | None =>
      None
    end
```

And then in another package tried to create a class that implemented the trait and inherited the method body for `_with_default`, you would get a compilation error stating that you can't lookup the private method `_with_default` from outside the package. This error happened because the call to `t._with_default()` in the trait was "losing the context of the call". This simple class was all that was needed to trigger the bug:

```pony
class C is T
  fun _override(): (T | None) =>
    None
```

We've updated the compiler to only check name visibility at the time the trait is not type checked, not each time a class that has inherited a default method body from a trait is checked.
