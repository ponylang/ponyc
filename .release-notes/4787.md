## Fixes segfault when accessing union in a tuple via Any

Previously, the following example would result in a segfault:

```pony
actor Main
  new create(e: Env) =>
    let x: Any val = ("a", (U8(1)))
    match x
    | (let a: String, let b: (U8 | U16)) =>
      b.string()
    end
```

The root issue is that in this very specific case, the format of the datastructure in "x._1" does not match the expected format in the match statement for "b". The former having a literal U8(1), the latter expecting a boxed Union type (U8 | U16). This mismatch caused the program to attempt to coax the U8(1) into a Pointer, causing a segfault.

The fix is to allocate a new object in the format that the match expects, and copy the data from the original location into it before matching.
