## Add guarded devirtualization for multi-subtype interface dispatch

When a method is called through an interface or trait that has 2–4 concrete implementing types, the compiler now emits runtime type checks with direct calls instead of a vtable lookup, allowing method bodies to be inlined.

The optimization applies automatically wherever the compiler finds a small, closed set of concrete types behind an interface. The biggest impact is on hot loops that dispatch through iterators — `fold`, `map`, and other itertools combinators, where the `Iterator` interface typically has two concrete implementations (`Iter` and `Range`). On a pi-computation benchmark, the fold-vs-loop overhead dropped from 2.5x to 1.5x.
