## Add .gitignore/.ignore support to pony-lint file discovery

pony-lint now respects `.gitignore` files when running inside a git repository and `.ignore` files in all contexts, matching the behavior of tools like ripgrep and fd. Files and directories matching ignore patterns are automatically excluded from linting.

Supported pattern syntax includes literal names, `*` and `**` wildcards, directory-only patterns (trailing `/`), anchored patterns (containing `/`), negation (`!`), and backslash escapes. Rules from child directories override parent directories, and `.ignore` rules take precedence over `.gitignore` rules in the same directory.

Hardcoded skips (`_corral/`, `_repos/`, and dot-prefixed entries) remain unconditional and cannot be overridden by negation patterns in ignore files. Explicit file targets passed directly to pony-lint are always linted regardless of ignore patterns.
