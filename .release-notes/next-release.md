## Fix C shims that include ponyassert.h

C shims that include `ponyassert.h` now compile with an installed compiler. Compilation previously failed because a required header was missing from the installation.

## Apply runtime tracing category changes to ASIO

Runtime tracing category changes now apply to the ASIO thread as well as worker and pinned schedulers. Previously, ASIO retained its startup categories, so enabling a category at runtime could omit ASIO events and disabling or replacing a category could leave ASIO events enabled.

## Fix compilation failure on OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD

ponyc failed to compile on OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD because the runtime's `ponyint_futimesat` wrapper called `futimesat`, which only exists on Linux and FreeBSD. The wrapper now uses `utimensat`, available on all supported platforms.

## Rename `ponyint_futimesat` to `ponyint_utimensat`

`ponyint_futimesat` has been renamed to `ponyint_utimensat`. Code that calls it via FFI must update the function name.

## Add Nix flake package for x86-64 Linux

ponyc can now be built and installed as a Nix flake package. `nix build .#ponyc` produces an installation that includes ponyc and all language tools (pony-lsp, pony-lint, pony-doc, pony-dep, pony-agent-server). Programs compiled by the installed ponyc link against libraries in the Nix store. A development shell for building ponyc from source is available via `nix develop`.

## Fix MultipartFormData header injection via CR and LF in names and content types

`MultipartFormData` wrote CR and LF from field names, filenames, and content types directly into part headers. An attacker who controlled a name, filename, or content type passed to `field()` or `file()` could inject extra headers into a part or end the part's header block early, moving attacker-controlled text into the part body.

Names and filenames are now percent-encoded following WHATWG (`%22` for `"`, `%0D` for CR, `%0A` for LF). `file()` rejects content types that contain CR or LF.

## MultipartFormData uses WHATWG percent-encoding; file() is now partial

`MultipartFormData` name and filename escaping has changed from backslash escaping (`\"`, `\\`) to WHATWG percent-encoding (`%22` for `"`, `%0D` for CR, `%0A` for LF). Backslash is no longer escaped — it passes through unchanged, matching what browsers send.

`file()` is now partial. It errors if the content type contains CR or LF, which would allow header injection. Callers must handle the error:

Before:

```pony
form.file("f", "photo.jpg", "image/jpeg", data)
```

After:

```pony
form.file("f", "photo.jpg", "image/jpeg", data)?
```
