## Add LSP call hierarchy support

The Pony language server now supports the LSP call hierarchy protocol:

- `textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy` — when the cursor is on a method or constructor, returns a `CallHierarchyItem` describing it.
- `callHierarchy/incomingCalls` — returns items for all methods in the workspace that call the given method, with the specific call sites within each caller.
- `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` — returns items for all methods called by the given method, with the specific call sites within it.

Editors that support this protocol (VS Code, Neovim, etc.) expose it as "Show Call Hierarchy", "Show Incoming Calls", and "Show Outgoing Calls" commands.

## Fix LSP range end positions overshooting past source line ends

Go-to-definition, document symbols, workspace symbols, type hierarchy, call hierarchy, and selection ranges could highlight text past the end of the declaration line. Editors that rely on this range for highlighting or cursor placement would overshoot into whitespace or the next token. This is now fixed.

## Fix LSP hover showing on declaration keywords

Hovering over a declaration keyword (`class`, `actor`, `trait`, `interface`, `primitive`, `type`, `struct`, `fun`, `be`, `new`, `let`, `var`, or `embed`) incorrectly showed a hover popup for the entity, method, or field being declared. Hover information now only appears when hovering over the declaration name itself.
