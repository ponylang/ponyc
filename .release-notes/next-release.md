## Fix crash when parsing, printing, or querying deeply nested JSON

Parsing, printing, or querying a deeply nested JSON value — for example a document of many thousands of nested arrays or objects — could overflow the stack and crash the program with a segfault, rather than returning a value or a catchable `JsonParseError`.

The `json` package now handles arbitrarily deep nesting, limited only by available memory.

## Reject an out-of-range `--ponygcinitial` exponent

`--ponygcinitial` sets the heap size at which an actor first garbage collects, given as the exponent `N` in a `2^N` byte threshold (the default is `2^14`, or 16 KiB). Passing a value of 64 or greater on a 64-bit platform — for instance mistaking the flag for a byte count and passing `--ponygcinitial 65536` — used to silently wrap around to a 1-byte threshold, making the actor garbage collect on nearly every allocation: the exact opposite of the large threshold the value implied. The runtime now rejects such a value with an error at startup instead of running with a wildly wrong threshold.
