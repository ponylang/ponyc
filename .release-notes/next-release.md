## Stop creating Centos 8 releases

CentOS 8 has been end-of-lifed and will be receiving no further updates. As per our policy, we will no longer be building regular releases for CentOS 8. Existing releases can still be installed via ponyup, but no additional releases will be done.

Our CentOS 8 support has been replaced by support for Rocky 8.
