## Add prebuilt ponyc binaries for CentOS 8

Prebuilt nightly versions of ponyc are now available from our [Cloudsmith nightlies repo](https://cloudsmith.io/~ponylang/repos/nightlies/packages/). Release versions will be available in the [release repo](https://cloudsmith.io/~ponylang/repos/releases/packages/) starting with this release.

CentOS 8 releases were added at the request of Damon Kwok. If you are a Pony user and are looking for prebuilt releases for your distribution, open an issue and let us know. We'll do our best to add support for any Linux distribution version that is still supported by their creators.
