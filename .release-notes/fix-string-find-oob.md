## Fix String.find and contains matching past the end of the string

`String.find`, `contains`, and `rfind` compared the needle byte by byte without checking that it fit within the string at each candidate position. When the needle extended past the string's size, the comparison read the null terminator or, for a trim view sharing a larger buffer, bytes from the parent string. `count` and `split_by` inherited the problem through `find`.

```pony
let s: String val = "abcd".trim(0, 2) // "ab", backed by "abcd"
s.contains("bc") // was true, now false
s.find("bc")?     // was 1, now raises error
s.count("bc")     // was 1, now 0
```
