## Fix ponyc crash when partially applying constructors

We've fixed a compilation assertion error that would result in a compiler crash when utilizing partial constructors.

Previously, this would fail to compile:

```pony
class A
  let n: USize

  new create(n': USize) =>
    n = n'

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let ctor = A~create(2)
    let a: A = ctor()
```
