## Add support for go to definition for arrow types in LSP

The LSP server now correctly handles "go to definition" for method calls on arrow types (viewpoint-adapted types like `this->Type`). 

Previously, go-to-definition would fail on method calls where the receiver had an arrow type, such as calling methods on `this` (which has type `this->MyClass` rather than just `MyClass`).
