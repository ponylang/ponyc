## Add support for go to definition for arrow types in LSP

The LSP server now correctly handles "go to definition" for method calls on arrow types (viewpoint-adapted types like `this->Type`). 

Previously, go-to-definition would fail on method calls where the receiver had an arrow type, such as calling methods on `this` (which has type `this->MyClass` rather than just `MyClass`). 

This is fixed by updating pony-ast to version 0.3.2, which includes a fix for [mfelsche/pony-ast#2](https://github.com/mfelsche/pony-ast/issues/2) that extracts the nominal type from arrow types before resolving definitions. As a result, the previous workaround for hover on function calls has been removed.
