## Add Support for Settings to pony-lsp

`pony-lsp` can now be provided with settings from the lsp-client (most of the time this is the editor).
It supports two settings, which are both optional:

- **defines**: A list of strings that will be defined during compilation and can be checked for with `ifdef`. Those defines are usually provided to `ponyc` with the `-D` flag.
- **ponypath**: A string, containing a path or list of paths (like used e.g. in the `$PATH` environment variable) that will be used to tell `pony-lsp` about additional entries to its package search path.

Example settings as JSON:

```json
{
  "defines": ["FOO", "BAR"],
  "ponypath": "/path/to/pony-package:/another/path"
}
```

## Improve pony-lsp diagnostics

`pony-lsp` only relayed the main message from errors provided by ponyc. Now, it also passes the additional information to help explain the error.
