## Fix `assignment-indent` to require RHS indented relative to assignment

The `style/assignment-indent` lint rule previously only checked that multiline assignment RHS started on the line after the `=`. It did not verify that the RHS was actually indented beyond the assignment line. Code like this was incorrectly accepted:

```pony
    let chunk =
    recover val
      Array[U8]
    end
```

The rule now flags RHS that starts on the next line but is not indented relative to the assignment. The correct form is:

```pony
    let chunk =
      recover val
        Array[U8]
      end
```
