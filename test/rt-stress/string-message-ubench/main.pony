"""
Stress tester for the Pony runtime.

This is a modified version of message-ubench. Message-ubench has proven to be
an excellent program for stressing the runtime and finding bugs. This modified
version passes Strings rather than I64s around amongst its various actors. The
change to String helps exercise the ORCA garbage collector in a way that using
I64's doesn't.

This stress test executes a sequence of intervals.  During an interval,
1 second long by default, the SyncLeader actor sends an initial
set of ping messages to a static set of Pinger actors.  When a Pinger
actor receives a ping() message, the Pinger will randomly choose
another Pinger to forward the ping() message.  This technique limits
the total number of messages "in flight" in the runtime to avoid
causing unnecessary memory consumption & overhead by the Pony runtime.
