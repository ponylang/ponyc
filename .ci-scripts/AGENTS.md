# .ci-scripts

Helper scripts that CI workflows call (Python and shell). Not part of the ponyc
build, the runtime, or the stdlib — these only run in GitHub Actions (and locally
when you want to exercise them).

## Python conventions

- **Stdlib only.** CI runners have no `pip install` step, so scripts must not
  import third-party packages. Use `urllib`, `json`, `subprocess`, `tarfile`,
  etc. — never `requests`, `pyyaml`, `pytest`, …
- **ruff lints everything here on every PR** (`.github/workflows/lint-python.yml`,
  which now only lints — the tests live in `test-ci-scripts.yml` and
  `test-rt-stress.yml`). There is no ruff config file, so the defaults apply. A
  `lint` job runs `ruff check .ci-scripts`; a separate `lint-rt-stress` job runs
  `ruff check test/rt-stress` — these conventions also cover `test/rt-stress/`,
  whose generative stress harness carries Python (an orchestrator) under the same
  rules even though it lives with a test rather than in `.ci-scripts/`.
- **Tests are `*_test.py` files, self-contained, no pytest.** Each is runnable as
  `python3 <path>/<name>_test.py`, exits 0 on pass / 1 on fail, and prints a
  one-line summary (see `pr_changed_suites_test.py` for the shape).
  **`test-ci-scripts.yml` discovers every `*_test.py` under `.ci-scripts/` (via
  `find … -name '*_test.py'`) and runs each one; `test-rt-stress.yml` does the
  same for `test/rt-stress/`, on Linux and Windows** — so a new `*_test.py` is
  picked up automatically — you do not register it anywhere. When you add or
  change a script, add or update its `*_test.py`; it will run in CI on the next
  PR.
- After writing a test, break each assertion once to confirm it actually fires
  (counterfactual check) before trusting it.

## Subdirectory and import conventions

- Related scripts are grouped in a subdirectory (e.g. `libs-cache/`). A script
  imports its **siblings by module name** (`import cache_arch`); this resolves
  because the scripts are invoked by full path, so `sys.path[0]` is the script's
  own directory. **Move a script together with its siblings and its importers**,
  or the imports break.
- A subdirectory mixes **entry scripts** (runnable by full path, each with a
  `main` and a CLI) with **support-library modules** (import-only, no `main`). In
  `libs-cache/` the library modules are `common.py` (die/info/`require_env`/the
  orchestrator helpers, plus the shared entry-script path constants
  `MAIN_CACHE`/`BRANCH_CACHE`/`PROMOTE`), `registry.py` (the GHCR registry-v2
  push/pull client, including `copy` — the cross-namespace promote the warmer uses
  to reuse a branch build), `ghpackages.py` (the GitHub-packages REST client), and
  `cache_arch.py` (arch normalization); the entry scripts (`*_libs_cache.py`,
  `resolve_libs_cache.py`) are thin layers over them — `promote_libs_cache.py`
  resolves the branch (source) and main (destination) names and calls
  `registry.copy`. Shared logic belongs in a library module, not copied across
  entry scripts.
- A module that derives the **repo root** from `__file__` (e.g.
  `libs-cache/registry.py`'s `repo_root()`) hardcodes the directory depth with a
  fixed number of `os.path.dirname` calls. If you move it to a different depth,
  update that count — `libs-cache/repo_root_test.py` pins it, so a wrong depth
  fails the test job rather than only surfacing at runtime in CI.

## Pointers

- The GHCR libs cache (the `libs-cache/` scripts: warmer, consumers, branch
  cache, retention, clear) is documented in
  `.known-couplings/ghcr-libs-cache.md`.
- The `bsd/` scripts provision the BSD CI VMs and run the in-VM libs handling,
  both shared by `update-lib-cache.yml` and `ponyc-tier3.yml`, one script per
  platform: `{freebsd,openbsd,dragonfly}-provision.bash` (+ `dfly_configure_vm.py`)
  boot and set up the VM, and `{freebsd,openbsd,dragonfly}-libs-cache.bash
  <operation>` restores or builds-and-pushes the libs cache over ssh. See the GHCR
  libs cache coupling in `.known-couplings/ghcr-libs-cache.md`.
- `windows-install-deps.ps1` installs the pinned msys2 lldb and the libraries it
  loads against. It holds the only copy of that pin, and every Windows job
  needing lldb calls it. Don't inline the `pacman` block into a workflow: the
  per-PR job that checks lldb's behavior has to install the same lldb the
  scheduled lanes do, or it guards a version nothing runs. The script's header
  carries the pin history.
