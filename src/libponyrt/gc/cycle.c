//
// About the Pony cycle detector
//
// The cycle detector exists to reap actors and cycles of actors. Not every
// Pony program needs the cycle detector. If an application contains no cycles
// amongst it's actors or is able via its shutdown mechanism to break
// those cycles then the cycle detector isn't need and is extra overhead. Such
// programs use the "ponynoblock" runtime option to turn off the cycle
// detector.
//
// Some applications do need a cycle detector in order to garbage collect
// actors. The job of the cycle detector is find groups of actors (cycles) where
// no more work is possible because all of the actors in the cycle are blocked.
// When the cycle detector finds a blocked cycle, it deletes the members of
// cycle.
//
// The cycle detector is a special actor that is implemented here in cycle.c in
// c rather than being implemented in Pony. Like other actors, it is run by
// the various schedulers. Unlike other actors, it does not participate in the
// scheduler's backpressure system as the cycle detector is marked as a "system
// actor". All system actors are not part of the backpressure system.
//
// The cycle detector has evolved over the years and is much more complicated
// now than it was in early versions of Pony. "In the beginning", every actor
// would send a message upon its creation to the cycle detector. This allowed
// the detector to track all the actors ahd use a protocol that still mostly
// exists to query actor's about there view of the world and put together a
// "omniscient" view of actor relations and find cycles of blocked actors.
//
// Early cycle detector designs had a few problems.
//
// 1. Every actor was communicating with the cycle detector which made a the
//    cycle detector a bottleneck in many applications.
// 2. The cycle detector was run like other actors which meant that it often
//    couldn't keep up with particularly "CD busy applications". When the cycle
//    detector can't keep up, memory pressure grows from it's queue.
// 3. The cycle detector was scheduled like every other actor and would steal
//    cycles from "real work actors". In some applications a non-trivial amount
//    of CPU time was spent on cycle detection.
// 4. It was easy to overload the cycle detector by creating large numbers of
//    actors in a short period of time.
//
// Despite these problems, the early cycle detector designs were relatively
// easy to understand and didn't contain possible race conditions.
//
// Over time, as we have evolved the cycle detector to be less likely to suffer
// from memory pressure or to be overly grabby with CPU time, it has gotten more
// and more complicated. It would be rather easy now when modifying the cycle
// detector to introduce dangerous race conditions that could result in crashing
// Pony programs.
//
// Changes that have been made to the cycle detector over time:
//
// The cycle detector is no longer run like a regular actor. Instead, it will
// only ever be run by scheduler 0. And it will only every be run every X amount
// of units (which is configurable using the `cdinternal` option). This
// scheduling change greatly dropped the performance impact of the cycle
// detector on "average" Pony programs.
//
// Early versions of the cycle detector looked at every actor that it knew about
// looking for cycles each time it ran. This could result in large amounts of
// CPU usage and severely impact performance. Performance was most impacted as
// the number of actors grew and as the number of CPUs shrank. Single threaded
// Pony programs with a lot of actors could spend a very large amount of time
// looking for cycles.
//
// Every actor informed the cycle detector of its existence via message passing
// when the actor was created. This could cause a lot of additional message
// activity.
//
// Every actor informed the cycle detector of its existence even if it was
// never blocked. This resulted in a lot of extra work as the purpose of the
// cycle detector is to find cycles of blocked actors. Despite this, all actors
// were informing the cycle detector of their existence.
//
// The relationship between individual actors and the cycle detector is now as
// follows.
//
// Actors only inform the cycle detector of their existence if they are blocked.
//
// We've introduced a concept of "orphaned" actor that at the time of their
// creation have a reference count of 0. Orphaned actors whose rc never gets
// above 0 can delete themselves locally like they would if `ponynoblock` was
// in use.
//
// Any actor that has had a reference count above 0 but currently has a
// reference count of 0 and is blocked can inform the cycle detector that it is
// blocked (and is isolated) so that the cycle detector can speed up reaping it.
//
// The three above changes can, for many applications, have a huge impact on
// performance and memory usage. However, these gains come at a cost.
//
// Early versions of the cycle detector were trivially race condition free. Now,
// it is non-trivial to keep cycle detector/actor interactions race free.
//
// Where there was once only one way for the cycle detector to become aware of
// an actor, there are now two. An actor might inform the cycle detector of
// itself when it blocks. A different actor that knows about an actor, might
// also have shared its view of the world with the cycle detector such that
// the cycle detector knows about the actor without it ever having contacted the
// cycle detector. This can result in the cycle detector having multiple
// protcol messages in flight that could be leading the deletion of an actor.
// Care must be taken in the cycle detector to not contact actors that are
// "pending deletion" as it could lead to a double-free.
//
// There are critical sections of "deletion" code that are non-atomic in both
// the actor and the cycle detector where for any actor, only the actor or
// cycle detector can be executing. If both sides were to be executing critical
// sections at the same time, a double free could result. We have an atomic
// in place on a per actor basis that is used to prevent both sides from
// executing their critical sections at the same time. If either can not
// acquire the critical section atomic, it means the other side is in their
// section and an invariant needed for safe deletion is about to be broken.
//
// If all of this sounds complicated, it is. Tread carefully. The three people
// who know the cycle detector best all approved performance improvements
// around the time of Pony 0.38.0 that introduced race conditions.
//
// We feel the additional complexity is worth it because the performance gains
// have been so large. However, we are looking at doing away with the cycle
// detector entirely and coming up with a decentralized approach to detecting
// actor cycles and reaping them. Until that time, we have the current cycle
// detector that has evolved to this state over time.
