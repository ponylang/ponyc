# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at coc@ponylang.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# Social Rules

In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy, we have a 
small set of [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) 
we follow. We (the project maintainers) lifted these rules from the 
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). We've seen these rules in effect
in other environments. We'd like Pony community to share a similar positive
environment. These rules are intended to be lightweight, and to make more
explicit certain social norms that  are normally implicit. Most of our social
rules really boil down to “don't be a  jerk“ or “don't be annoying.” Of course,
almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so telling people not to be
jerks isn't a very productive strategy.

Unlike the anti-harassment policy, violation of the social rules will not result 
in expulsion from the Pony community or a strong warning from project
maintainers. Rather, they are designed to provide some lightweight social 
structure for community members to use when interacting with each other.

## No feigning surprise. 

The first rule means you shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know 
something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can't believe you 
don't know what the stack is!") and non-technical things ("You don't know who 
RMS is?!"). Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit: 
When people feign surprise, it's usually to make them feel better about 
themselves and others feel worse. And even when that's not the intention, it's 
almost always the effect.

## No well-actually's

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not 
entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor 
correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on 
the actual conversation. This doesn't mean we aren't about truth-seeking or 
that we don't care about being precise. Almost all well-actually's in our 
experience are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking.

## No subtle -isms

Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and 
other kinds of bias. This one is different from the rest, because it covers a 
class of behaviors instead of one very specific pattern.

Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, things that 
we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying "It's so easy my 
grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, 
this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it's not a big deal 
to mess up – you just apologize and move on.

If you see a subtle -ism in the Pony community , you can point it out to the
relevant person, either publicly or privately, or you can ask one of the project
maintainers to say something. After this, we ask that all further discussion 
move off of public channels. If you are a third party, and you don't see what 
could be biased about the comment that was made, feel free to talk to the 
project maintainers. Please don't say, "Comment X wasn't homophobic!" Similarly,
please don't pile on to someone who made a mistake. The "subtle" in 
"subtle -isms" means that it's probably not obvious to everyone right away what 
was wrong with the comment.

If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, 
please feel free to reach out to any of the project maintainers.
