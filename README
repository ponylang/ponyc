Building on Linux
=================

First, install premake4 and LLVM 3.5 using your package manager. You may need to install zlib and ncurses as well.

This will build ponyc and compile helloworld:

$ premake4 gmake
$ make config=release
$ ./bin/release/ponyc test/examples/helloworld

Building on Mac OSX
===================

First, install homebrew if you haven't already (http://brew.sh). Then brew both llvm35 and premake4, like this:

$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install llvm35
$ brew install premake

This will build ponyc and compile helloworld:

$ premake4 gmake
$ make config=release
$ ./bin/release/ponyc test/examples/helloworld

Building on Windows
===================

The LLVM 3.5 prebuilt binaries for Windows do NOT include the LLVM development tools and libraries. Instead, you will have to build and install LLVM 3.5 from source. You will need to make sure that the path to LLVM/bin (location of llvm-config) are in your PATH variable.

You will also need to build and install premake5 (not premake4) from source. We need premake5 in order to support current versions of Visual Studio.

You may also need to install zlib and ncurses.

$ premake5 vs2013
$ Release build with Visual Studio (ponyc.sln)
$ ./bin/release/ponyc test/examples/helloworld
