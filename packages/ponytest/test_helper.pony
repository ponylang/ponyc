class val TestHelper
  """
  Per unit test class that provides control, logging and assertion functions.

  Each unit test is given a TestHelper when it is run. This is val and so can
  be passed between methods and actors within the test without restriction.

  The assertion functions check the relevant condition and mark the test as a
  failure if appropriate. The success or failure of the condition is reported
  back as a Bool which can be checked if a different code path is needed when
  that condition fails.

  All assert functions take an optional message argument. This is simply a
  string that is printed as part of the error message when the condition fails.
  It is intended to aid identifying what failed.
