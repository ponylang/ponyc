struct RuntimeOptions
  """
  Pony struct for the Pony runtime options C struct that can be used to
  override the Pony runtime defaults via code compiled into the program.

  The way this is done is by adding the following function to your `Main` actor:

  ```
    fun @runtime_override_defaults(rto: RuntimeOptions) =>
  ```

  and then overriding the fields of `rto` (the `RuntimeOptions` instance) as
  needed.

  NOTE: Command line arguments still any values set via
        `@runtime_override_defaults`.


  The following example overrides the `--ponyhelp` argument to default it to
  `true` instead of `false` causing the compiled program to always display
  the Pony runtime help:

  ```
  actor Main
    new create(env: Env) =>
      env.out.print("Hello, world.")

    fun @runtime_override_defaults(rto: RuntimeOptions) =>
      rto.ponyhelp = true
  ```
  """

/* NOTE: if you change any of the field docstrings, update `options.h` in
 *       the runtime to keep them in sync.
