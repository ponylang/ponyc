storing references

primitives and concrete types (actor or class) are simple
create individual pointers for singleton types, so that no pointer to another
  type can clash with them

this leaves traits, structurals, unions, isects, tuples
with the scheme below
  traits: simple pointer
  isects: simple pointer
  tuples: anonymous structs, passed by value
    pattern match: check each element



instance
  concrete type descriptor
  data

concrete type descriptor
  trace function
  serialise function
  deserialise function
  array[type as trait]

type as trait
  pointer to trait name
  vtable for type as trait

type as structural
  treat all structural types as "anonymous traits"
  when we assign a value to a structural type:
    concrete type: add the structural as a trait vtable to the type
    trait or structural: retrofit to all types that implement the trait

call method on trait
  convert method to index at compile time
  linear search the traits by name
  call the function in the vtable by index
  optimisation by common subexpression elimination

pattern match on type
  type is concrete: check descriptor pointer
  type is a trait: linear search on traits





vtable/object pairs

primitive: bytes
singleton type: constant pointer
concrete type: data pointer
trait: vtable + data pointer
structural: vtable + data pointer (how to calculate the vtable?)
union:
isect:
tuple: structure of types, pass by value

vtable
  concrete type descriptor pointer
  array of function pointers

concrete type descriptor
  ...




method name colouring
  method name -> index mapping at compile time
  invoke by index

single vtable for all objects
directly index the method, no need to find the right vtable
no need for separate vtables for structural types
have to box primitives when passed as a trait or structural type

primitive: bytes
  boxed when passed as a trait, structural, union or isect
singleton type: constant pointer
concrete type: pointer
trait: pointer
structural: pointer
union: pointer
  except if a union of the same type with different capabilities
  use high bits for capability in a union?
isect: pointer
tuple: structure of types, pass by value

pattern matching on type
  primitive, singleton type, concrete type
    object vtable pointer == type vtable pointer
  trait
    each type has a list of traits it implements
  structural type
    not allowed
  union
    do we match any one element
  isect
    do we match all elements
  tuple
    do we match all elements pairwise
    tuple can also match Any
    anonymous struct
    always boxed
