inferring type arguments based on arguments can be done later
  when done, more function types can be subtypes of other function types

treat a constructor as a function with type parameters?
  same type parameters and constraints as the type
  can try to infer them the same way
  return type is the type itself, unreified
    will be reified with the type arguments of the function when resolved

when we see a function call
  we know the receiver
  use it to look up the function by name
    or "apply" if there is no name
  we get the function as reified by the receiver
    so the receiver's type parameters are already resolved in the function
  we apply type qualifiers if we have them
    if we do, we're done: type qualifiers are all or nothing
    if not, we use the parameters to try to infer type parameters
      if we can't, that's an error *before* the parameters are checked
  now check the parameters against the reified function
  if the parameters are ok, we have a reified return type

when reifying, we have to reify our constraints as well
and check our constraints as we go
  fun tag foo[A: Number, B: Seq[A]](list: B): A
  foo[I32, List[I32]](list: Seq[I32]): I32
  but the reified version is NOT a subtype of the unreified version in this case

when we see a nominal TK_TYPEDEF
  the type parameters must all be present: no parameters to infer
  reify the constraints with the type arguments
    don't worry about whether those type arguments are within constraints or not
    possibly this means no ordering constraint for type parameters
    need to change the way scope insertion is done to accept:
      class Foo[A: Seq[B], B: Number]
      Foo[List[I32], I32]
        A: List[I32] -> Foo[A: Seq[B], B: Number]
        B: I32 -> Foo[A: Seq[I32], B: Number]
        List[I32] <: Seq[I32]
        I32 <: Number
  check all the type arguments to see if they are subtypes of constraints
  reify the type with the type arguments

F-Bounded?
  class Ordered[A: Ordered[A]]
  reify with its constraints:
  Ordered[Ordered[Ordered[Ordered[...]]]]
  but we don't reify after reifying so:
  Ordered[Ordered[A]]
  replace anything unbound with Any
  Ordered[Ordered[Any]]
  type check with that
  for an actual implementation...
  String is Ordered[String]
  Ordered[String] -- reify as Ordered[String] is Comparable[String]
    is String <: Ordered[String]? Yes, it's in the traits
    is String <: Comparable[String]? Yes, it's a trait of Ordered[String]

  fun tag min[A: Ordered[A]](a: A, b: A): A =>
    if a < b then a else b end
  qualified with own constraints:
  fun tag min(a: Ordered[A], b: Ordered[A]): Ordered[A] =>
    if a < b then a else b end
  actually, no, it is this:
  fun tag min(a: Ordered[Ordered[A]], b: Ordered[Ordered[A]]):
    Ordered[Ordered[A]] =>
    if a < b then a else b end
  replace unbound with Any
  fun tag min(a: Ordered[Any], b: Ordered[Any]): Ordered[Any] =>
    if a < b then a else b end
  this type checks
  trait Foo[A: Foo[A]] is Ordered[A]
  fun tag min[A: Foo[String]](a: A, b: A): A
    Foo[String] !<: Ordered[Foo[String]]
    Foo[String] <: Ordered[String]

fun tag min[A: List[B], B: Ordered[B]](list: A, item: B): B =>
  [List[String], String] ->
  [A: List[String], B: Ordered[String]]
  List[String] <: List[String], String <: Ordered[String]
for type checking the body, we want:
fun tag min(list: List[Ordered[Any]], item: Ordered[Any]): Ordered[Any] =>
so A = List[Ordered[Any]], B = Ordered[Any]
map self reference to Any first
  typeparams = [A, B]
  constraints = [List[B], Ordered[B]]
  f_constraints = [List[B], Ordered[Any]]
reify f_constraints with itself to get typeargs
  typeargs = [List[Ordered[Any]], Ordered[Any]]
apply typeargs

trait Ordered[A: Ordered[A]]
  typeargs = [Ordered[Any]]

fun tag foo[A, B](a: A, b: B, c: B) =>
  b = c = b // swap b and c, this is ok
  // or is it? B: Foo iso would not be ok
  a = b = a // definitely not ok
  // but need to have different types when type checking the body to know this

no need to replace self reference?
just treat it as some nominal type with no functions or fields
but each a distinct type

what about capabilities for typeargs?
to allow any cap:
  it could be tag, so can't read or write
  it could be mut, so can't send
  it could be iso, so can't alias as our own type
if we want to read
  can't be tag
if we want to write
  can't be imm, box, tag
if we want to send
  can't be trn, mut, box
could specify a set of capabilities?
  A: Foo {iso, tag}
simpler: just make it a subtype relationship
  then type check the class again with the typeargs
  mark methods that don't typecheck with those typeargs as unavailable
  can use this to supply some functions only when certain conditions are met

implicit recover?
  for any expression that accesses only sendable identifiers
