## Update to work with latest ponyc

The most recent ponyc implements [RFC #65](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/main/text/0065-env-root-not-optional.md) which changes the type of `Env.root`.

We've updated accordingly. You won't be able to use this and future versions of the library without a corresponding update to your ponyc version.
